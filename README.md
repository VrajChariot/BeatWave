## üéµ Usage

Once installed, BeatWave provides an intuitive interface for music playback:

* **Song Library:** Songs are dynamically fetched from the `songs/` directory. Each song folder contains an `info.json` file with its metadata (title, artist, description, image, and audio).
* **Search Functionality:** Use the integrated search bar to filter songs by title or artist. Click the close button to clear the search.
* **Play Controls:** Use the play/pause button to toggle playback. Navigate to the previous or next song using the respective navigation buttons.
* **Seekbar:** Drag or click on the seekbar to jump to any specific part of the song. The seekbar updates in real-time.
* **Responsive Experience:** On mobile, the sidebar is hidden by default and accessible via the hamburger menu. Controls are optimized for smaller screens.

## üìù Code Documentation (High-Level)

The core logic of BeatWave resides in `script.js`.

### Global Variables

* `currentSongIndex`: Tracks the index of the currently playing song in `songsList`.
* `songsList`: Stores the list of all songs fetched dynamically.
* `isPlaying`: Boolean flag to indicate current playback state (play/pause).
* `currentAudio`: Reference to the HTML Audio object for the playing song.
* `initialSongInfo`: Metadata of the first song loaded on startup.
* `isDragging`: Boolean to track if the seekbar is being dragged.
* `draggedTime`: Stores the time corresponding to the dragged seekbar position.

### Key Functions

* `fetchSongsList()`: Retrieves song data, either via GitHub API (for a dynamic library) or a local fallback.
* `fetchSongInfo(songName)`: Fetches `info.json` metadata for a given song.
* `updateSeekbarInfo(songInfo, audio)`: Updates UI elements like seekbar progress, song details, and timestamps.
* `formatTime(seconds)`: Utility function to format time into `MM:SS`.
* `playSong(index)`: Core playback function; loads, plays, updates UI, and manages audio events.
* `setupControls()`: Initializes event listeners for all playback controls and seekbar interactions.
* `updateSeekPosition(offsetX, totalWidth)`: Calculates and updates the seekbar position and corresponding timestamp during user interaction.
* `displaySongs()`: Renders the song list in both library and grid views, setting up playback click events.

### Event Listeners

Event listeners are set up for the search button, close search button, search input field, hamburger menu (for mobile navigation), and all playback controls and seekbar elements.

## üé∂ Metadata Format (`info.json`)

Each song in the `songs/` directory must have an `info.json` file structured as follows:

```json
{
    "title": "Song Title",
    "artist": "Artist Name",
    "description": "Brief description of the song.",
    "image": "cover_image.jpeg",
    "audio": "audio_file.mp3"
}
```
### Responsive Design
BeatWave is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a great experience across all devices:

* **Desktop:** Sidebar and main content are displayed side-by-side, offering full functionality.
* **Mobile:** The sidebar is hidden by default, accessible via a hamburger menu. Controls are optimized for smaller screens.
